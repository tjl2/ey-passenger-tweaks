# Max pool size is the maximum number of application instances that may be
# *simultaneously active*.  A larger number results in higher memory usage, but
# improved ability to handle higher concurrency of HTTP client requests.

# If an application instance has not received any traffic after the given number
# of seconds, then it will be shutdown in order to conserve memory.
#
# Decreasing this value means that applications will have to be spawned more
# often. Since spawning is a relatively slow operation, some visitors may notice
# a small delay when they visit your Rails/Rack website.
#
# If the application has low to no requests overnight then this feature can be
# utilized in order to free up memory at night for background processing jobs.
#
# When set to 0, application instances will not be shutdown unless necessary.
#
# Setting the value to 0 is recommended if you’re on a non-shared host that’s
# only running a few applications, each which must be available at all times.

# Default User/group switching.
#
# This sets the user/group that the passenger process will run as.
# For security we do not want application instances running under passenger to
# run as the root user, thus we set them to run as an unprivileged user.
#
passenger_user_switching on; # Yes this is the default, here for clarity.
# A Rails application is started as the owner of the file config/environment.rb,
# and a Rack application is started as the owner of the file config.ru.
# Note that under NO circumstances will Passenger spin up an application
# running as the root user, it will default to the user/group we set here.

# Friendly Error pages
#
# Typically we do not want end users to be able to see application error
# information. This setting prevents that, in order to gather the same
# information look into the main Nginx error log.
passenger_friendly_error_pages off;

#
# Start application instances immediately instead of waiting for the first
# request. This eliminates the 'first request is slow' "issue".
#
# Enable on a case per case basis, may be used multiple times in the http block.
# Any (single) valid url for the application based on the server { location {} }
# configurations is permitted.
#
# This feature is most effective when used together with passenger_min_instances

#
# Logging
#
# 0: Show only errors and warnings, default.
# 1: Show the most important debugging information. This might be useful for system administrators who are trying to figure out the cause of a problem.
# 2: Show more debugging information. This is typically only useful for developers.
# 3: Show even more debugging information.
#
# Warning: Do not leave this set above 0 unless actively debugging :)
#

#
# The reason we separate out the passenger error/debug log file here is so that
# debugging applications which are failing to start or are throwing errors is
# much easier as we do not have to filter out standard web request errors.
